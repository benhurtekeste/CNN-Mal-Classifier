## 🎯 Overview

This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for classifying malware samples based on their visual representations. By converting malware binaries into grayscale images, we leverage computer vision techniques to identify and categorize different types of malware, providing a novel approach to malware detection and classification.

## 🔧 Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- PyTorch
- torchvision
- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

## ⚙️ Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/CNN-Mal-Classifier.git
cd CNN-Mal-Classifier
```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install required packages:
```bash
pip install torch torchvision numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn jupyter
```

## 🚀 Usage

1. Open the Jupyter notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook malware_classifier.ipynb
```

2. Follow the notebook cells to:
   - Load and preprocess the malware images
   - Train the CNN model
   - Evaluate model performance
   - Make predictions on new samples

## 🧠 Model Architecture

The CNN architecture consists of:
- Convolutional layers for feature extraction
- Max pooling layers for dimensionality reduction
- Fully connected layers for classification
- ReLU activation functions
- Dropout for regularization

## 📊 Dataset

The project uses the Malimg dataset, which contains grayscale images converted from malware binaries. The dataset includes various malware families and their corresponding visual representations.

Dataset structure:
- Multiple malware families
- Grayscale images (converted from binary files)
- Standardized image dimensions

## 📈 Results

The model achieves competitive performance in malware classification:
- High accuracy in distinguishing between different malware families
- Robust feature extraction from visual patterns
- Fast inference time for real-world applications
